                    Technique</a> is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] The
                technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated
                by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the
                tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.[2][3]

                The latest collection of Trumpian verse is <strong>The Beautiful Poetry of Donald Trump</strong>, by
                McSweeney’s writer Rob Sears. Consider:<br><br>
                <strong>I am the best</strong><br>
                <br>
                I predicted Apple’s stock would fall<br>
                <br>
                I will build a great, great wall<br>
                <br>
                I build buildings that are 94 stories tall<br>
                <br>
                My hands – are they small?<br>
            </cite>
            The technique has been
                widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to
                concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design; the
                method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.[4]
